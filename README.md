# Supercapacitor-Battery-combo-in-Electric-Vehicles
This project provides a way of using supercapacitors in tandem with batteries in electric vehicles to achieve the following benefits:
  1. Reduction of the peak currents in batteries to increase battery life.
  2. Improving an electric vehicle's acceleration & driving range.

The project involves a matlab simulation of an electric vehicle being alternatively driven by a battery and a supercapacitor in different stages of its motion i.e accleration/deceleration/constant motion.
